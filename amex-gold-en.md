## How the Amex Belgium Gold Referral Program Works (Simple Explanation)

1. Someone with an Amex card in Belgium shares a **referral link**.
2. You apply for the Amex Gold card **using that link**.
3. If you are **approved** and meet the conditions (such as minimum spend and time period),  
   - **You** may receive a **welcome bonus** (e.g. extra points or miles).  
   - **The referrer** may also receive a **referral bonus**.

The exact number of points, the type of bonus, and the spend requirements **change regularly**, so always read the latest details on the Amex site when you apply.

## A Bit More Detail (For Those Who Want It)

- **Eligibility**  
  Typically, you need to be **resident in Belgium**, have a **sufficient income**, and pass the usual **credit checks**. Exact criteria are listed on the official application page.

- **Welcome bonus**  
  The welcome bonus linked to a referral can be **better** or **different** from the standard website offer. It may require you to spend a certain amount within a fixed period (for example, the first few months).

- **Referral bonus for the referrer**  
  When you use a referral link and are approved, the person who referred you may earn **additional points or miles**. This does **not** reduce your own bonus; it is extra for the referrer.

## Frequently Asked Questions about the Amex Belgium Gold Referral

**Is it safe to use a referral link?**  
Yes, as long as the link takes you to the **official American Express website** (you should see the correct domain, e.g. `americanexpress.com` or the official `my-amex.be` domain). Always double‑check the URL before entering any personal information.

**Do I get the same welcome bonus as on the normal Amex site?**  
Sometimes the **referral offer can be better** than the standard public offer, but it depends on the current promotion. Always compare what you see after clicking the referral link with what is advertised publicly.

**Does using a referral link cost me anything extra?**  
No. The **annual fee** (if any) and all other conditions are displayed clearly on the application page. Using a referral link does not add extra fees; it usually just changes the bonus structure.

**Can I get the referral bonus more than once?**  
The rules for repeat bonuses can be strict. In some cases, if you already had the same card recently, you may **not** be eligible for a welcome bonus again. Check the exact terms on Amex’s website.

## Tips Before You Apply

- Make sure the **annual fee** and **spending requirements** fit your budget.
- Plan your expenses so you can comfortably meet any **minimum spend requirement** for the welcome bonus without overspending.
- Consider whether you will actually use the **benefits** (travel perks, insurance, points partners, etc.).
- Always read the **latest conditions** on the official site, as this page is just a personal guide, not official financial advice.
